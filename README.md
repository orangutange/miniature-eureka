# miniature-eureka

Currently WIP

To Do List:
  1. Better Critical Service Configuration
  2. Implementation of a stored list of Users, Admins, Critical Services (Rerunning script will be faster) - did that
  3. Check for backdoors before calling softwareCheck or removeProhibitedSoftware (Backdoors use prohibited software)
  4. Add Extra Configuration (/etc/sudoers, crontabs check, /etc/rc.local) - this can be done manually, except maybe for rc.local(1 line)

rxshark did nothing
